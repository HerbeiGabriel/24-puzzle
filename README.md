The 24 puzzle is math game in which the player is given 4
digits and he/she must figure out a way of combing these digits and
the addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)
operators such that the result is 24.
The result is computed in sequential order on the digits. For example,
if the digits are 3, 4, 4, 9 and the user enters the three operations as +,
-, * then the calculation is done as follows:
3 + 4 = 7.
7 - 4 = 3.
3 * 9 = 21.
